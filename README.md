# Steinberg-3vertex

The [**Steinberg signature**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000634958683449X?via%3Dihub) is a signature of non-equilibrium conditions in Markovian systems. Using higher-order autocorrelation functions of the form $G^{\alpha,\beta}$ and $G^{\beta,\alpha}$, this method allows one to detect whether or not a given system obeys detailed balance. Here, we present computational tools for calculating the Steinberg signature on a 3-state Markov process, represented by the [**linear framework**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036321). In particular, for a linear framework graph $G$ with any given parameterization, we want to be able to calculate the Steinberg signature and determine how it varies in response to increasing thermodynamic force of the underlying system.
