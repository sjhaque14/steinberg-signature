# Steinberg-3vertex

The [**Steinberg signature**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000634958683449X?via%3Dihub) was published in 1986 as a method to detect broken detailed balance in nonequilibrium systems, particularly in biochemical contexts. It exploits statistical properties of noise signals emitted by stochastic systems, particularly Here, we present computational tools for calculating the Steinberg signature on a 3-state Markov process, represented by the [**linear framework**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036321). In particular, for a linear framework graph $G$ with any given parameterization, we want to be able to calculate the Steinberg signature and determine how it varies in response to increasing thermodynamic force of the underlying system.

The Steinberg signature is a signature of non-equilibrium conditions in Markovian systems. Using higher-order autocorrelation functions of the form $G^{\alpha,\beta}$ and $G^{\beta,\alpha}$, this method allows one to detect whether or not a given system obeys detailed balance.
