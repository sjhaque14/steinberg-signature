# general-graph-utils.py

# This library allows the user to greate linear framework graphs (finite, directed graphs with no self-loops and labeled edges). The user can randomly generate a strongly connected and fully reversible linear framework graph G, calculate its Laplacian matrix and its spectrum, and calculate the Steinberg signature from that matrix. The user can also determine how the Steinberg signature changes as a function of increasing entropy production. This software was developed using the NetworkX software package (https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html)

# Note that the user is required to create both a directed graph object and an undirected graph object. This is because some of the functions in this file require the undirected graph object as an argument (particular the cycle-related functions).
